# Build a Shopping App

In this project, you will build a small shopping app which supports rating and commenting on products. Your mentor has set up the Express server configuration and added a simple HTML/CSS example. It's your job to turn this into a working application using MongoDB.

## First Steps

1. Ask your project leader to fork the [existing app repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-project-shop-comments).
2. Read the instructions in the app repository. Do you understand what's expected of you?
3. Discuss with your group how to divide up the project and assign responsibilities.
3. Read the rest of this document before beginning.

## Final Product

When you complete the project, we'll expect to receive a pull request at the [app repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-project-shop-comments) from your fork. This pull request should contain all the work you've done to implement the instructions.

Be sure to alert the mentors when you make the pull request so that we can review it.
